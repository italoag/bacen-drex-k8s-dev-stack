# Note: in a kubernetes secret the string (e.g. generated by htpasswd) must be base64-encoded first.
# To create an encoded user:password pair, the following command can be used:
# htpasswd -nb user password | openssl base64
# Or create a new file with the credentials you want and then convert it when your are done
# htpasswd -c auth username
# *enter and reenter password*
# htpasswd auth username2
# *enter and reenter password*
# base64 auth
# copy and paste into below
# the |2 should stay regardless of how many users. It is yaml syntax.
# Below are username/passwords test/test and test2/test2
